## Objective
![Product Name Screen Shot](img/screenshot.png)

To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads  data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Context

The best way to learn about programing is to complete a project using that programming language. This project helped me build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web application.

## The 5 W's

1. Who—My professional network, as well as potential employers.
2. What—A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an external API.
3. When—The code for the app is accessible for viewing in my GitHub repository.
4. Where—Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code directly from my GitHub repository or be directed to my GitHub profile from my portfolio site.
5. Why—For my potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how I create the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how I test and debug my code.

## Features and Requirements

### User Goals

My users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.

### Key Features

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Load data from an external source (API)
* View a list of items
* On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

### Technical Requirements

#### Required:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API .
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
* The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on  demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
  * The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
  * The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or  touch interactions.
  * The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
* The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can  review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &  Web Hosting ).
* The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
